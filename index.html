    <p>This website provides detailed information about all core classes in PadManiacs. Use this reference when creating addons to understand available APIs and modification points.</p>
    
    [heading: "Introduction"]

    <p>PadManiacs supports community-created modifications through an add-on system. Add-ons can:</p>
    [list]
    * Replace game assets (arrows, backgrounds, UI elements)
    * Add new behaviors and gameplay mechanics
    * Extend the game with new features
    [/list]
    
    [heading: "How addons work"]
    <p>An addon is a folder that contains data that the game loads at startup, overwriting the assets and default game behavior.</p>
    
    <p>In order for an addon to be considered valid, it must include the [code: "manifest.json"] file, a file that defines metadata, which parts of the game must be modified or extended, as well as the data and the code that must be loaded.</p>
    
    <p>Add-ons are stored at a subfolder [code: "Addons/"] under local storage folder. All Addons you develop must be inside this folder so you can test them in the game.</p>
